There are 2 classes of bin packing instances:
1) Uniform class consists of items of sizes uniformly distributed in (20,100) to be packed into bins ofsize 150.
2) Triplet class consists of 'triplets' of items from (25,50) to be packed intobins of size 100.
For the 'triplets' class, the instances were constructed with a known global optimum of n/3 bins, i.e. the guaranteed optimal solution has exactly three items per bin.
The format of these data files is as follows:
For each test problem (p=1,...,P) in turn:
  Bin capacity, Number of items (n), Number of bins in the current best known solution
   For each item i (i=1,...,n): size of the item
